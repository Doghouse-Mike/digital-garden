# SWRPG Session 7

Bit of a catch up/regroup

Left off we've just "got" the ship, bounty hunter guy betrayed us, Mouth helped us take him down after talking him down failed. Snuck out of prison without attracting any immediate attention, left guards alive

Spent some XP n that, worked out where we're at

On the ship!

Found 9 crates, 1 meter by 1.5, with timers on. Ship said something about destabilising in a couple weeks. 

Found a donked up, shell of an astromech

Got into the ship comp. Doesn't say what the cargo is. Needs dropping at "the wheel" in advance of the deadline/timer. 5k credits on the line for successful delivery.

Vlodimir Garin is the fence

Triumphant jump to hyperspace headed towards blah blah then thingy
