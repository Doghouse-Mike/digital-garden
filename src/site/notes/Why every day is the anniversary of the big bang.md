# Why Every Day is the Anniversary of the Big Bang

Okay so no physicist have posted here yet, I’ll going to give you the real answer of the anniversary of the Big Bang.

Let’s say you could teleport back to the Big Bang with a indestructible, perfect atomic clock. You could conceivably pick the clock back up now, read the days and divide by 365.2422 and you’d have an accurate date of the the anniversary of the Big Bang.

Now the issue is that you want the clock to end up sitting on earth when you get back to today - for example, it’s no good if the clock ends up stuck in orbit around a distant star.

Since you’re very smart you manage to think of a way around this. You figure out what atoms and particles from the Big Bang that are going to eventually form the earth and you decide to glue your atomic clock to the side of an atom (for the purpose of this experiment, your clocks are invisible, microscopic and weight zero kg). You’re also very throughout and have a lot of clocks so you decide to glue an atomic clock to every single atom that makes up the earth, just to get a good read out.

Why do you find when you get back to 2024 and read all the clocks?

You find every single clock is different.

You see, time isn’t solid - it stretches, speeds up and slows down depending things like relative speed and gravitational fields. Every atom in earth experienced a different path in the 14 billion years before they got to earth. Every atom will have experienced a different length of time to get to now and all lengths are true and valid. And 14billion years is plenty of time for the date to be smeared out between the earth atoms, pretty much evenly. Some of those atoms could have experienced billions of years less than other atoms, even if they were created at exactly the same time.

As such, when you divide the clocks by 365.2422 you’re going into get every single day on the calendar, and that’s the answer.

The anniversary of the Big Bang is every day on the calendar for approximately 1/365th of the atoms that make up you, the earth, your mom and your pet turtle, Alan.
